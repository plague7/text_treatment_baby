       " 'Not for the very petite I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.',\n",

(store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.',\n",

I\\'m 5\"5\\' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn\\'t too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you\\'re less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath.',\n",
       " \"Dress looks like it's made of cheap material Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.\",\n",
       " 'Perfect!!! More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid',\n",
       " 'Runs big Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn\\'t bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).\\r\\nmy stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it\\'s running big.\\r\\nthe straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.\\r\\ni\\'m 5\\'6\" and it came to just below my knees.',\n",
       " 'Pretty party dress with some issues This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip',\n",
       " \"Nice, but not for my body I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!\",\n",
       " \"You need to be at least average height, or taller Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you.\",\n",

I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand, but i\\'m a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5\\'4\" frame, yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i\\'m just not sure it hangs right on me. it\\'s fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely, and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting.',\n",

These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes, i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these.\",\n",
